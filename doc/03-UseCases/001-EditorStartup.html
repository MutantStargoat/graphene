	Basic flow
</h2><hr/>

<ul>
	<li>
		User starts the Editor executable
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Editor persistence is loaded.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Editor windows/panels etc are placed/resized to match the last active layout (saved in persistence).
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The last active project is found in editor persistence and loaded.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The <a href="../02-NLRequirements/Editor.html">asset library</a> is refreshed. This normalizes any file changes the user may have done to the assets files.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<a href="../01-Requirements/GUI-Pre-analysis.html">Asset hierarchy panel</a> is populated with the assets that exist in <a href="../02-NLRequirements/Editor.html">project assets directory</a>.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The last active scene of the project is loaded.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<a href="../01-Requirements/GUI-Pre-analysis.html">Scene hierarchy panel</a> is populated with the loaded scene's objects.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Control is passed to the user.
